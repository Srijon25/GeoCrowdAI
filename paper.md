# Summary

**GeoCrowdAI** is an open-source Python framework for real-time crowdsourced geospatial intelligence analysis. It captures live text streams such as tweets, analyzes their content using natural language processing (NLP), extracts relevant geographic information, and maps emerging hotspots or risk zones dynamically.

This framework enables rapid situational awareness for use cases like disaster monitoring, urban planning, emergency response, and public safety. GeoCrowdAI emphasizes modularity, allowing easy integration of new data sources, models, and map layers.

# Statement of Need

Existing geospatial systems often depend on delayed structured data. GeoCrowdAI addresses the gap in **real-time public data analysis** by combining NLP with geocoding to extract and map spatial patterns from free-text sources such as social media or SMS streams. Researchers, NGOs, and emergency planners can use it to get live, actionable insights.

# Features

- Real-time NLP-based keyword filtering
- Location extraction and coordinate mapping
- Modular plug-and-play architecture
- CLI for live analysis and mapping
- Compatible with Twitter, custom logs, or any text stream
- Lightweight and customizable

# Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install

Example Use

from geocrowdai.stream import StreamProcessor
stream = StreamProcessor()
stream.listen()
