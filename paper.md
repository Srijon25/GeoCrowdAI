## Summary

GeoCrowdAI is a modular, open-source platform for real-time crowdsourced geospatial data collection and AI-enhanced analytics. It allows researchers, developers, and analysts to gather, analyze, and visualize location-based insights contributed by a global user base. Its modular architecture supports plug-and-play AI models, efficient data pipelines, and interactive visualizations for tasks such as disaster response, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.

## Statement of need

Existing solutions either focus on static crowdsourcing or proprietary data pipelines. GeoCrowdAI uniquely bridges the gap between real-time crowd inputs and intelligent spatial analysis using open technology. It supports rapid deployment for research applications and field-based interventions in dynamic environments.

## Repository

https://github.com/example/GeoCrowdAI

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/GeoCrowdAI.git
cd GeoCrowdAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Use

```python
from geocrowdai import live_input, run_analysis

data = live_input(stream=True)
results = run_analysis(data)
```
